#Truffle

I made a clone of the [Canopy](http://www.canopy.co) site using Rails and Backbone.js. Canopy is a curated Amazon shopping experience and I really liked their aesthetic and thought it would be a great opportunity to practice a lot of my skills.

The first made the app in Rails and got a basic framework together and working. I then began
to port over to Backbone and added additional features. I spent a lot of time working on my CSS to create a clean
and enjoyable user experience.
